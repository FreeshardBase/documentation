# Payment Options

As a developer of Portal-apps, you automatically earn money from people who have your app installed.

    Payment processes are not yet implemented.
    You cannot profit from them yet and their implementation - when completed - might differ from this description. 

Portal's payment scheme for app developers aligns incentives in a way that works best for everyone.
App developers receive a monthly payment that scales with the number of installed app instances
and users have no additional cost when installing apps, so they are not discouraged from doing so.
The process is also very low-effort for both parties with regard to setup and maintenance.

It works like this:

1. Part of each user's monthly subscription fee is a mandatory flat app payment of a few euros.
2. The Portal monitors which app are installed during each month and for how long.
3. From that, the Portal calculates a distribution, weighing each installed app.
4. It notifies the user of the calculated distribution and allows them to make changes.
5. It sends the distribution to our payment backend.
6. We split the flat app payment of that Portal according to the distribution and book the amount to the app developer's balance.
7. The app developer may withdraw their current balance manually or have it sent automatically to their account.

You, the app developer, have an incentive to build useful apps that users will install and keep.
In addition, you profit more the fewer other apps a user has installed. 
This is the case if your app covers many use-cases and is versatile.
