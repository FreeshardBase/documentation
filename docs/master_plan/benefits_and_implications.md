# Most Important Benefits

For the most part, Portal doesn’t allow the owner to do anything brand new that was not possible before. But it changes the playing field on which digital life happens.The benefits it offers are more of a fundamental nature as it removes a lot of the complexities and adverse side effects we got used to over time because we had to.

## Oneness

What is the center of your digital self? Your email? Your Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn page? The stuff you keep on your phone or notebook? For many, this is not easy to answer because all of it is important. But there is nothing that holds it all together, no center, nothing to call home. Just fragmented bits on devices or behind accounts.

It will be a huge relief to finally have a single place for everything. We expect this to be the experience where people will ask why it has not been done this way long ago. In hindsight and when you get used to it, it will seem glaringly obvious.

All of your data will exist only once, your contact list is managed once, every app is installed just once and all of your devices show you one singular view. For all intents and purposes, your Portal will be the only computer you will use, the one that unifies everything.

The overhead that this eliminates is huge and probably amounts to many lost weeks over a lifetime. No more data needs to be copied or synced between devices, no more exporting and importing stuff between web services, we can even get rid of the bane of the internet: passwords! When looking back at today, these things will look like manually cranking the engine to start a car.

And the same is true for app developers. By its nature, it will be a breeze to develop for Portal because so many functions are just part of the platform itself: hosting, data storage, secure authentication, contacts, end-to-end encrypted communication, just to name a few. A developer will use an API to access these functions and not need to worry about them themselves.

Portal really strips away a lot of the accidental complexity for users and devs and lets us all concentrate on the intentional complexity.

## Sovereignty

When the internet was adopted by the masses it was open and decentralized and no one really controlled it. We all had high hopes that it would improve relationships between all of humanity. That did not happen and instead it has become a surveillance and manipulation engine much more powerful and dangerous than anything before.

To explain the role Portal can play in this context, we should very briefly look at a bit of history.

It seems like the problem was one of timing. At the moment where the first web (Web 1.0) was established and people were ready to participate online (which would be known as Web 2.0) there was no simple way for them to do that. Some assumed that people would start building their own servers and websites but the expertise and patience required for this made it unviable for most. So there was an unfulfilled demand for a while and it was filled by the first centralized social networks, first among them Facebook. They allow participation and relieve you of the burden of managing the technicalities.

In a search for monetization strategies, they found advertising to be elegant. The service could remain free for users and still make money. It might have been a good idea at first but as we see today, it soon got out of control and today’s users are primarily ressources from whom attention is to be extracted as efficiently as possible and whose thoughts and attitudes are for sale.

Let’s look back at the fateful moment when people were ready to participate and their only real option was centralization. What would have happened if instead a company made hosting your own server radically simple and that became the backbone of Web 2.0? Would we still have a decentralized internet today? Would people's private data have remained on their private devices? If someone proposed a model like Facebook, would we laugh them out the door?

Perhaps the technology was not ready at the time, but now it surely is. And Portal is the attempt to right that historical wrong turn. If successful, it will be able to restore the balance of power between tech companies and the people.

For many individuals, this might seem like an abstract benefit, not easily grasped. But for society as a whole, it is a crucial improvement. Manipulation of public discourse is immensely dangerous to our ability to find solutions to our most pressing problems. There are credible reports that link targeted manipulation on Facebook to the Brexit vote and Trump’s election, two incidents that we consider extremely harmful. And what fuels the manipulation is surveillance. Only if you know an individual’s behavior intimately, can you decide which ad to show at what time in what context for maximum impact.

Wide adoption of Portal turns off that flow of private data and starves the machinery that relies on it.

## Beyond physical devices

We are many years into the era of cloud computing. One would expect that physical devices are unimportant and easily interchangeable by now. But surprisingly, they are still extremely important and many people store data exclusively on their PC or always need to find their smartphone when using a specific app.

The promise and expectation of cloud computing paints a picture of data and applications that are just somehow there, almost independent of any physicality. You could just pick up any device and let it be your gateway to all of your digital life. This has not materialized for several reasons.

Firstly, there is no all-encompassing piece of cloud for you to use so each app has its own little cloud-backend where it is separated from other apps and behind a separate account. What could have been a collection of apps in one space is a collection of services with all the additional friction that comes with it. When accessing something from a new device, instead of logging in to one space, you need to log in to each app separately. Avoiding that effort leads to a kind of device lock-in.

Secondly, people don’t trust the cloud and for good reason. With tens of services each of us uses, how are you supposed to tell secure ones from those that cannot protect your data or even outright sell it? Are you supposed to do research on each single one? Better to not trust any one and keep personal data locally.

Portal attempts to solve both problems. It is exactly this all-encompassing piece of cloud that has been missing and that you can use for anything from anywhere with a single login. And it attempts to solve the trust problem using multiple measures like separated infrastructure for each customer or aligned incentives through a subscription-based model.

The original promise of cloud computing can finally become reality. Your cloud - your Portal - can completely replace anything that is tied to the physical world. Your devices are just an empty shell for your Portal to inhabit. And any device can play that role, even if just for a few minutes. This can completely change our habits regarding digital technology, and we will explore the larger implications later.

# Implications

Adoption of Portal - in particular mass adoption - offers many more beneficial implications. When thinking it through, it is surprising how many things work better just by arranging the digital primitives more naturally.

## Implications for Portal owners

If you own a Portal, your digital life is pretty different from what it is today. Mostly because so much friction is just gone and things just work as you expect them to, as it is obvious. The individual benefits are what motivates people to own a Portal.

### Identity is easy

Earlier, we described that there is no real identity to your digital self. The thing that comes closest is your email address and that is still awkward since writing emails is just one simple use-case that now somehow has to fill the shoes of symbolizing your identity.

But your Portal can fill that role. It is yours, personally, so there is a one-to-one relationship between your Portal and you as a person. It has an identity that is fit for computers to authenticate (its public/private key) and relatively easy for humans to handle (in the shape of the six-digit Portal-ID). So the Portal can act on behalf of its owner when contacting other Portals or accessing resources on the internet and always prove its authenticity. This gets rid of passwords!

If you think about it: the necessity of passwords is another byproduct of having multiple devices. If we would use just a single device all the time, it could just save the password upon registration - similar to a cookie - and we would never have to even see it. Only the need to prove our identity from other devices creates the need for exposing users to passwords directly. Portal is exactly this single device besides which we need no other. That is why it can represent us so well.

TODO: describe grouping of peers and badges that can be given away. Both can be used for access control.

### 2FA is easy

Of course, passwords are also weak. Over time, many tricks have been developed that allow attackers to learn passwords. For that reason, the inconvenient crutch that are passwords was extended by another even more inconvenient crutch: 2FA codes. They are regenerated every few seconds and you need a device or app that handles that and which tells you the currently valid code for your login.

And of course more and more web-services adopt the practice and so your authenticator app is filled up with tens of 2FA codes, just like it happened with your password manager before. We just doubled the cognitive load of authentication.

It is worth noting that machine-to-machine authentication is pretty easy and extremely secure if you use public/private key pairs, like Portal does. As explained above, Portal can authenticate itself with any other system it is in contact with. So what remains is the Portal’s owner authenticating themselves with their Portal.

Here, we can use all kinds of methods: device pairing, unprivileged pairing for untrusted devices, two-device confirmations for critical actions, recovery codes that are printed on paper, and so on. The thing is: a user has to do this all only with one service, their Portal, not with tens of services like today. And that shrinks the cognitive load significantly.

### Syncing between devices

This problem is just gone. Not solved - gone. It does not appear at all if you use a Portal.

There are no different devices since your physical devices are just empty shells that connect to your single Portal. It is the single source of truth. Whatever apps you installed there, data you saved there, it just appears on all of your devices simultaneously.

### Device-specific apps are gone

A corollary of the omni-device nature of Portal that is still worth mentioning separately is the reduction of device-specific apps. Those are the apps that exist only for one platform: PC or mobile. Whenever you sit at your desk and still have to get your phone to do something you are probably using such an app.

As soon as someone fully switches to Portal, these will be gone. Every app on Portal is cross-platform by nature, making it easier for users but also for developers who don’t have to maintain multiple versions of their app.

There will probably be exceptions, e.g. apps that make no sense without big screens and mouse/keyboard input like 3D modeling applications or certain games. But since the vast majority of today’s web-apps works well on many device classes they will, too, on Portal.

### Fully automated backups

It is a bad idea to have no backup strategy for your devices. But implementing a good one needs some work and there are some details one can easily get wrong. You will want an incremental backup, so it runs fast. Some older backups should be kept in case you need to retrieve something you deleted a while ago. But they should be deduplicated or else the needed storage will be huge.

Setting this up and managing it is not productive work, it is friction. But it should be done. The heterogeneity of platforms and devices prevents a good one-size-fits-all solution.

But of course, Portal can do it all for you, out of the box, you don’t even need to activate it, you don’t even know it is happening until you want to retrieve it. We don’t call it a fully-managed service for nothing.

Portal’s backups have all the properties described above and they are encrypted client-side which means the storage that contains them (which is of course not the Portal itself) only ever sees encrypted data. If needed, you can download a full backup of your Portal for a given time. We will keep these even if you cancel the service, so your data will not get lost.

### Contact management

It is normal for every operating system that some concerns are solved by each app and other concerns are solved by the OS so all apps can benefit. The latter are usually low-level things like managing network traffic or drawing pixels on a screen. The app tells the OS what to do using an API.

When Portal is used at the owner’s main platform, the set of concerns that Portal can manage grows. Now it also contains things that usually get out-of-sync when using multiple platforms or web services. One great example is contact management: the list of people you know and whose contact details you keep.

Think for a moment how many such lists you are managing right now. You probably have a phonebook on your phone and that might be the main one. But then, you may have friends on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and all the other social networks. Are all these lists in sync? Probably not.

### Portal controlling devices

We have covered in detail how a Portal can be controlled from all of an owner's devices but the reverse is true as well. When pairing a device with your Portal, the Portal can now control the device. So each paired device extends the range of capabilities of the Portal. Here are a few examples how this can be useful:

* The Portal can determine which device the owner uses or is close to at any moment and route notifications to that device only instead of triggering a crescendo of notification sounds everywhere.
* Apps can use multiple devices at once, e.g. display media or information on one device while allowing user interaction with another. This would be similar to the ChromeCast feature but with fewer restrictions. You could use a fixed device in a meeting room to display and control a slide deck from your Portal. Also games could make use of this pattern.
* Running interactive sessions, e.g. a phone call, can be smoothly transferred between devices. When coming home, you could transfer an ongoing call from your phone to a set of speakers or your TV.
* 
There surely are many more ideas that app developers will think of.

## Implications for society

From a bird-eye view on a whole society, Portal brings many benefits as well. These are the effects that are in fact most important to us since they have the potential to facilitate real, much-needed change in many critical areas. But history has shown that the greater good is not a sufficient motivation for many people to buy and use a product. That is why benefits for individuals are needed. They pull people in. The more important benefits for society are achieved almost as a side-effect.

### Identity is easy (part 2)

Famously, “on the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” What was once a fun point of a cartoon has evolved into a real problem. But dogs are not the problem, bots are. And as fake content gets more sophisticated and is mass-producing convincing audio, images, and video, we face an epistemological crisis we are nowhere near prepared for. How is the average person supposed to tell apart authentic from inauthentic content?

Portal might just be a puzzle piece for a solution. Proving the authenticity of a piece of data is mostly a solved problem in cryptography at least since the 80s when asymmetric cryptography was developed and is an integral part of any modern encryption scheme. By digitally signing data, one can prove that it is authentic in the sense that the signer approves of it in some way. 

The problem is that the signer is a pretty abstract concept, because it is in essence a cryptographic key. The key is associated with some real-life entity like a person but now proving the association between key and person is the real challenge, particularly from a UX perspective. At one point, people imagined regularly coming together to key-signing parties in order to check and verify these associations. This of course never has remotely reached the mainstream.

Portal however has your cryptographic identity built-in in the shape of your Portal’s ID. Simple as a telephone number, prominently visible in the UI and cryptographically secure, this just might prompt people to get used to identifying others in that way.

That in turn would allow people to prove their authenticity and that of the data they share to others in a verifiable way. It would give people a stamp of approval they could attach to data, allowing them to mark authentic material and allow others to tell it apart.

### More economical physical devices

When fully embracing Portal, your physical devices are just an empty shell, as said before. One implication of this is that the device need not be as powerful as they are now. Most of the heavy lifting regarding processing and data storage is done by the Portal, the device only renders the UI. Devices can be more economical, cheaper, less resource-intensive and also live longer before they need to be replaced.

Also, sharing of devices is becoming more viable because pairing and unpairing is so quick and easy. If you only need a tablet or a desktop computer from time to time, it might be ok to only have one in a family that everyone may use. Floating desks in companies that embrace a hybrid office model will also be much easier to implement.

Ultimately, this might lead to a more conservative use of physical devices and the resources and processes needed during production.

### Decentralized personal data

No system is perfectly secure. There is always a risk for bad actors to find and exploit a vulnerability. We have seen many services over the years that have been hacked and where user data was stolen. There is no reason to assume Portal is different.

However, Portal has an advantage: personal data is not stored centrally in a single storage system. It is distributed among all the individual Portals, each a separate piece of infrastructure. If one Portal is compromised, only the data of one individual can be stolen. There are natural moats between all users. We regard this as an important defensive position that reduces the scope of any data theft.

### Distributed infrastructure means distributed power

There is no denying that putting the means of mass conversation in the hands of private companies has been a mistake. We describe the fallout above. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of alternatives, at least none that have caught on.

After all, any alternative must provide hosting for persistent user profiles, messages, media, and so on. And until now, the default method to achieve that was putting it all on more or less centralized servers because no one wants to manage their own server. But that also means that the power over the conversation is centralized.

Portal offers the infrastructure that is needed for mass conversation but it does that in a truly decentralized way. Now, it is radically easy to manage your own server. There is no place for a gatekeeper, no one can subtly nudge public conversation.

It remains to be seen if conversations become better with that model. They will surely become more authentic and people will be less prone to be thrown into extremist rabbit holes in order to maximize their engagement. We hope that this goes some way to mitigate the ideological rifts that have been growing so rapidly in recent years.

## For developers

Portal is a two-sided product. On the one side, there are owners of Portal, our customers. On the other side are developers that adapt or create applications to run on Portal. Both sides complement each other. So it is important to make developers’ lifes as easy as possible and Portal is well-equipped to do that. Like with the owners’ experience, the main benefits lie in the things that need not be thought about at all.

### Hosting and Infrastructure

Today, if you develop any app that is not totally self-contained on a single device (only very few are), there needs to be some kind of backend. This should generally be always available. So the task of an app developer is not only to build the app, but also to continuously provide the backend and manage any maintenance tasks that come up. If they fail or for some reason stop to do so (e.g. lack of interest or bankruptcy), their app might lose critical functionality or stop working completely.

Not so on Portal. Each individual Portal provides the infrastructure an app can run on. As a developer, you just have to publish the app. There are no additional ongoing obligations. Features that currently are only possible with a continuously running backend - like multi-device sync or a permanent online presence - can now be achieved by a built-once application.

### All things crypto

Security and cryptography are complicated topics. But for many use-cases, they are unavoidable. Whenever you manage public-facing infrastructure, you need to concern yourself with certificates. And if you want to give users the option to talk to each other with a high degree of privacy, you need to build end-to-end encryption into your app - a very difficult undertaking!

A side-note: the fact that chat apps need to be bundled together with their own encryption is an affront to all good software engineering. Chat and encryption are two completely separate problems, they should be solved separately. The reason this does not work is that encryption relies on identity and there is no persistent cryptographic identity for people, so each app has to have their own.

With Portal, those difficult problems are completely managed by each Portal itself. The developer need not even know about it. Portal offers an API that allows them to send encrypted messages to other Portal and authentication is handled by the Portal’s own certificate. It even checks all incoming connections to an app and makes sure they are allowed and if they originate from a paired device, another Portal or are anonymous and labels them as such. Each app can then simply decide what to do with them and focus fully on the actual business logic.

### User Management

When building a web-application or one with a backend, you need to manage your users. Each one needs an identifier (probably an email address) and a password at least. Perhaps, you mandate 2FA. You need to make sure that every request is properly authenticated and authorized.

Each instance of a Portal app only serves a single user, the one on whose Portal it is installed. For many apps, this means that a whole lot of complexity just vanished. And if an app needs communication between users, Portal offers a simple API that allows it to query its peer Portals and talk to the app instance that is installed there. Again, all details are taken care of by the Portal itself.

### Monetization

Monetizing application development for small companies or individual devs is often not very straightforward. Portal offers a revenue share model which has significant advantages. Most importantly for developers, they have to do almost nothing to profit from people using their apps, apart from telling us where to wire the money. And most importantly for users, they never have to pay anything on top of the Portal subscription fee they already pay. That way, they are incentivized to install any app they like and as many as they like without a second thought.

We describe this model and its implications in more detail later.
