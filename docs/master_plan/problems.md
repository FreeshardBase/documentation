# Problems that need solving and how they work

We are currently organizing our digital life in a certain way. We did not consciously choose it that way, instead it evolved over time. Most long-term developments happen like that. However, over time, many problems crept in that we did never properly solve. Instead, we either accept and normalize them (e.g. targeted ads) or we only treat the symptoms by adopting a protective stance (e.g. password managers).

Solving those problems at their root cause would require a more fundamentally different way of organizing digital life. This is what Portal attempts. Answering the common question that start-up founders get asked - “What problem does your product solve?” - is therefore not easy, or at least not quick. It improves the way we organize data and applications and that is deeply baked into the digital life of almost every individual or business.

However, we can provide a list of several of the most prominent problems that Portal solves, or rather, that it prevents from becoming problems in the first place.

## Friction in everyday digital life

When energy is lost to friction, it means that a part of the energy you put into a system is spent in an unproductive way and is no longer available for the actual task you want to do. Digital systems have friction, too. It is the time a user must spend on tasks that are needed just to keep the system running properly. With today’s systems, that friction is high and can and should be lowered.

First, think about what your actual tasks are when working with a computer: communicating with others, consuming or creating media, programming, gaming, and so on. Next, think about all the things you are doing to be able to do those things: managing passwords (creating, changing, entering them), transferring data or files between devices or people or applications, doing backups, updating software, upgrading or replacing hardware.

All the time and energy spent on the second category is unproductive friction. We deal with it by using crutches like password managers, file sync services, or we avoid the things that introduce it, like switching between different tools for the same task (this leads to vendor lock-in). Some just have to be done, e.g. backups, updates, upgrades. Of course there is always the option of just not doing it and taking the significant risk of losing all your data or having your identity stolen.

The way Portal works resolves all those points of friction mentioned above. Many can become fully automated, no user intervention required, e.g. backups. But for some problems, it gets even better: they simply no longer apply. Examples are passwords or data sync between devices.

## Identity of Humans

Each person is unique and physically exists only once. However, in the digital realm there are lots of copies of us, many entities that all represent a single person. Try and count the number of logins you have, one for each platform or service or social network. Each of your accounts is a different representation of you, each one (hopefully) with a different login.

Maybe your email address is the one connecting factor and you are represented by it? So how many email addresses do you have? And are you maybe logging in to some services with Google or Facebook? Those are more sources for fragmentation. And anyway, email is a specific use-case, conceptually, it makes little sense to also be the thing that uniquely identifies you. This pattern is a crutch that was at hand when needed and got normalized.

So there is no single concept that is your identification in the digital realm. That makes it difficult to prove to a server on the internet that you are really you. The solutions are mainly passwords with all of their problems.

## Surveillance Capitalism

A lot has been written about the dangers of surveillance capitalism. In short: when using platforms and services, users are intimately tracked - where they click, what they watch, where they scroll past, where they pause, and so on. Tech companies learn a lot about every individual (interests, behavior, life situation, …) and use that data to get them hooked on their content. By filtering and presenting content just right, engagement (or rather addiction) can be maximized. This process is totally automatic and self-learning. The goal is to put each advertising message only in front of the eyeballs of those that are most vulnerable to it.

Of course, all advertising is manipulation, some more malicious than others. But the algorithm does not differentiate between harmless and harmful ads. Examples for the latter are political hit-pieces, conspiracy theories, or fake news. And so the case can be made that targeted advertising played a role in some of the most harmful political decisions of the past like Brexit or Trump.

What can be done about it? Look at the start of the value-chain of surveillance capitalism: tracking of users. This is where it all begins. The data that is gathered by deep surveillance is the fuel for all of it. Without it, it would be unknown which ads should be presented for maximum effect. Each user would be a blank page. That is the desirable state we should strive for.

But users can only be tracked because they have no choice but to enter the realm of the tech companies which means using services that those companies host, being a fly in their web. So the first step is giving people a choice about it, allowing them to do all the things they are used to but on their own terms, inside their own home. Once deprived of their fuel, the steady stream of behavioral data, manipulative services will lose much of their power.

## Multi-Device Fragmentation

Until the late 2000s, computing felt much different. You had your computer at home and on it was your data, organized with a file-system, and the applications that you installed. This was your primary digital device that tied everything together. But then, the first iPhone was released and soon, smartphones gained more and more significance. For some people, they even replaced the PC as the primary device.

This change in device preferences made everything much more complicated. Since people expected to access data and use apps on all of their devices, they had to be organized in a different way. Apps moved out from peoples owned devices to the cloud so you could access them with your account from your PC and your smartphone. This made surveillance possible as described above. Since those apps could not easily access your filesystem and now you had a separate filesystem on each device anyway, your data moved in with the application itself, also to the cloud. It, too, could now be surveilled and it was now bundled with the application, creating silos and further reducing the control people had.

So the fact that people started using more than one digital device started a process that a) made many things more complicated and b) made people give up control over their digital assets and c) made it easy to scrutinize and manipulate them.

If we could go back to using just a single device, we would be far less dependent on centralized applications we have no control over. There would not be the need to put data out of our hands, just to make it available on different devices. But surely, this is not possible, we need different devices. On the go, we need the lightweight and compact smartphone, when working, we want the powerful PC with large screens.

However, Portal offers a way to have both: multiple physical devices to adapt to different situations and a single platform owned by the user themselves.
