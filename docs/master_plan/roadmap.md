# Roadmap

* Endgame is simple
  * Portal should cover all computing needs
  * some stories later
* first steps must be more conservative
  * solely browser-based interaction to save dev effort
* 3rd party apps that were originally built for selfhosting
* important goal: get a self-enforcing feedback loop going
  * users pay for Portal
  * revenue gets shared with app developers
  * app developers see opportunity and improve/adapt/fork apps for Portal or make exclusive apps
  * Portal becomes more useful
  * more users pay for Portal
  * repeat...
